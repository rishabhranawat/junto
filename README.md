## Flask App - Backend

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Make sure you have Python installed on your system.


2. **Virtual Environment (Optional but recommended):**
   - It's a good practice to create a virtual environment to isolate your project dependencies.
   ```bash
   python -m venv myenv
   source myenv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use 'venv\Scripts\activate'
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Install requirements
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the App:**
   - Now, run the app:
   ```bash
   flask run
   ```

5. **Access the App:**
   - Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:5000` to see your Flask app in action.

That's it! You've got your Flask app up and running. Remember to adapt the instructions to your specific project structure if needed. Keep it simple, and you'll be coding in no time! ðŸ˜„ðŸš€
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Next JS - Frontend

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
