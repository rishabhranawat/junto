1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Make sure you have Python installed on your system.


2. **Virtual Environment (Optional but recommended):**
   - It's a good practice to create a virtual environment to isolate your project dependencies.
   ```bash
   python -m venv myenv
   source myenv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use 'venv\Scripts\activate'
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Install requirements
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the App:**
   - Now, run the app:
   ```bash
   flask run
   ```

5. **Access the App:**
   - Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:5000` to see your Flask app in action.

That's it! You've got your Flask app up and running. Remember to adapt the instructions to your specific project structure if needed. Keep it simple, and you'll be coding in no time! ðŸ˜„ðŸš€
